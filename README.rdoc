== Devise simple_form views generator

This gem is an add-on to the excellent devise gem from plataformatec (http://github.com/plataformatec/devise).

It's a new generator to replace the default devise_views generator.

* Views are generated to work with simple_form gem (also for plataformatec http://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form)
* Views are fully localized i18N. Two locale files are generated (English and French)
* A small CSS file is also generated just for your eyes :)
